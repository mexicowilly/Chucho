Chucho Installation
===================

Prerequisites
=============
    Chucho requires that CMake version 2.8 or later be installed. You
may download CMake from http://www.cmake.org.

    At present Chucho is only known to work with compilers clang 4.2.1
and later and g++ 4.7 and later.

Build
=====
    Chucho can be built with the following commands, run from the source
directory:

    $ cmake .
    $ make
    $ make install

    Here are some interesting options for CMake that can affect the
build. You set these with the command-line switch -D, as in
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/special/location.

    * ENABLE_SHARED: (ON or OFF) Whether you prefer to have a shared
      object over a static library. The default is OFF.   
    * ENABLE_FRAMEWORK: (ON or OFF) Whether you prefer to have a
      framework on the Macintosh operating system. If you choose to
      build a framework, then it will be installed to
      /Library/Frameworks. Otherwise, the library will be installed to
      the location of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. The default is ON.
    * CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: (A directory) If you would like to install
      Chucho to a particular location, you may set it here. The default
      is /usr/local on POSIX system and C:\Program Files\CHUCHO on
      Windows. If you are on Windows, I highly recommend that you change
      this to something more suitable.
    * INSTALL_SERVICE: (ON or OFF) Whether you want the install target
      to install the chuchod log server as a system service on
      platforms that support system services. The default is ON.
