# Chucho
Chucho is a C++14 logging library that supports hierarchical
loggers and many different output destinations, called writers.

Chucho is built with CMake, and you can see what options are available
in the `cmake/BuildOptions.cmake` file.

**NOTE:** The configuration file is your primary interface to the library. Since  
[version 2.8](https://bit.ly/3aFVaDa), the configuration
file reference appears as a section of the [API documentation](https://github.com/mexicowilly/Chucho/wiki/API-Documentation).

Also, the full API, for times when more control is needed, is [documented](https://github.com/mexicowilly/Chucho/wiki/API-Documentation).
