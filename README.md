# Chucho
Chucho is a C++14 logging library that supports hierarchical
loggers and many different output destinations, called writers.

Chucho is built with CMake, and you can see what options are available
in the `cmake/BuildOptions.cmake` file.

To get started, please refer to the [configuration reference](https://github.com/mexicowilly/Chucho/wiki/Configuration),
as the configuration file is your primary interaction with the library.

Also, the full API is [documented](http://www.chucho-log.org/release-2.1).
